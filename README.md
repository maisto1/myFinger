# Finger-Like User Info Tool

## Overview

This is a lightweight C program that mimics the basic behavior of the Unix `finger` command. It displays information about local system users, such as login status, last login time, and optional `.plan`, `.project`, or `.forward` files if present.

**Note:** This tool only supports **local user information** â€” no remote user lookups.
